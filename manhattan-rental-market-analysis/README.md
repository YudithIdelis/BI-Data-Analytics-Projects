## 📊 Project 1: Manhattan Rental Market Analysis
In this project, I analyzed a dataset of Manhattan short-term rental listings to support data-driven decision-making for pricing and market positioning. I was tasked with answering the following business questions:
- Which listings generate the highest estimated annual revenue?  
- What property characteristics are associated with higher revenue performance?  
- How does demand vary across rental types and neighborhoods?  

To answer these questions, I cleaned and structured the raw dataset, developed a revenue estimation model, and analyzed engagement and pricing patterns. I documented my methodology, assumptions, and findings across key sheets including: **"Executive Summary" and "Issues, Assumptions, Change Log".**

### 📉 Key Findings
- Revenue is highly concentrated in premium Manhattan neighborhoods.  
- Single Room listings generate higher annual revenue than entire home listings.  
- Review count strongly correlates with projected revenue, indicating engagement as a demand proxy.  
### 📁 Tools Used

- Excel (Pivot Tables, Aggregations, Calculated Fields)  
- Data Cleaning and Validation
