## 📊 Project 0: Manhattan Rental Market Analysis
In this project, I analyzed a dataset of Manhattan short-term rental listings to support data-driven decision-making for pricing and market positioning. I was tasked with answering the following business questions:

- Which listings generate the highest estimated annual revenue?  
- What property characteristics are associated with higher revenue performance?  
- How does demand vary across rental types and neighborhoods?  

To answer these questions, I cleaned and structured the raw dataset, developed a revenue estimation model, and analyzed engagement and pricing patterns. I documented my methodology, assumptions, and findings across key sheets including: **"Listings Clean," "Revenue Estimates," and "Neighborhood Analysis."**

### 📉 **Key Findings**
- Revenue is highly concentrated in premium Manhattan neighborhoods.  
- Entire home listings generate significantly higher annual revenue than private rooms.  
- Review count strongly correlates with projected revenue, indicating engagement as a demand proxy.  

### 📁 Tools Used
- Excel (Pivot Tables, Aggregations, Calculated Fields)  
- Data Cleaning and Validation
